- 🎨 Customizable theming
- 🔍 Full-text search capability
- 📱 Mobile-responsive design

## What This Project Documents

This project documents a comprehensive developer guide aimed at:
- **Backend and Frontend Concepts:** Covering CRUD operations, API requests, validations, and more.
- **Deployment Strategies:** From GitHub Pages to static hosting platforms like Netlify and Vercel.
- **Best Practices and Troubleshooting:** Offering tips for code quality, performance, and solution strategies.
- **Development Workflow:** Guiding through installation, local development, and production build steps.

Additional topics include detailed explanations for using Docusaurus, MDX formatting, and custom theming options. This project is intended for developers who want an all-in-one reference for building and managing technical documentation, ensuring that both novice and experienced developers can easily navigate and contribute.

## Current Status

**Work in Progress**  
This documentation is actively evolving. We are continuously improving content coverage and clarity. Some sections may need further details and examples. Your feedback is welcome!

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Yarn package manager
- Git

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Install dependencies
yarn
```

### Local Development

```bash
yarn start
```

This launches a local development server at `http://localhost:3000` with hot-reload enabled. The site will automatically refresh when you make changes to the content.

### Building for Production

```bash
yarn build
```

This command:
- Generates optimized static assets
- Creates a production build in the build directory
- Performs bundle optimization and minification
- Generates search indices

The output can be deployed to any static hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages).
